Ideally, Real Estate Buyer's Agents are self-motivated, personable, and driven by personal achievement. In addition, administrative and research skills are a must.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Real Estate Buyer's Agents earn money for each transaction they complete. As you make more transactions, you earn more income.After a few years of disciplined work, it's not unusual for a Real Estate Agent to be earning over $100,000. The more work you put into establishing a client base, the more money you will earn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Regulatory Notice: While a real estate license is not required to apply, you must obtain a real estate license before officially being hired.
